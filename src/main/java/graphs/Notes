1. BFS should be applied when
-- level order traversal is needed
-- simultaneous travel is needed
-- when there are multiple source at same time to be started with
-- need to move one step at a time
-- need to move in multiple direction from one point e.g.: up right down left

2. Where we are checking if(!visited[i][j]) on codition true set visited[i][j] = true in immediate next line
