--include exclude technique
--at row level there are options either given in pblm or else incl and excl. These are not to be considered as an actual
value of rows.
-- What this technique tells is when traversing from left to right, when inserting data in particular cell/ column, compare
all the values that are at row level and select any one of those. i.e. include any one value and exclude other value.
e.g.: in case of maxSumNonAdjSubset... either we are including that value or exlcuding. i.e. take or not take and if include a value
then we need to exclude value which is present at 2nd row i.e. dp[1] and if including the excluded value i.e. dp[1] then excluding the
included value i.e. dp[0]
-- similar is the case of paint house where if 1 house has 3 prices for 3 colors red, green and blue in that case for other house
if we need to select red then we need to exclude red of first house and take max of blue or green of first house and add it to
red price of second house
